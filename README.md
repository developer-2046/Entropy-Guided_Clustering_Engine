## 💡 Project Highlights

- Calculates **Shannon Entropy** from eigenvectors of correlation-distance matrices
- Extracts **λ₁, λ₂, λ₃**, **average degree**, and **network entropy**
- Clusters feature windows into regimes using **K-Means**
- Projects regime space using **PCA**
- Overlays major market **crashes** on time series
- Trains:
  - A **LSTM** to predict regime transitions
  - A **Transformer** to learn temporal dependencies with **self-attention**
- Visualizes attention maps to show which time steps influenced the model

## 🔹 Models Trained

| Model         | Input (20-day window) | Target          | Accuracy |
|---------------|------------------------|------------------|----------|
| LSTM          | 7 entropy features     | Regime cluster   | ~36%     |
| Transformer   | 7 entropy features     | Regime cluster   | ~26%     |

## 🔹 Attention Visualization

Each heatmap shows how much each day in the 20-day sequence attends to others. Helps identify high-influence days that drive regime predictions.

## ▶️ Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/entropy-guided-clustering-engine.git
cd entropy-guided-clustering-engine
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then launch Jupyter and run the notebooks in this order:
1. `01_intro_clustering.ipynb`

## 🔖 TODO

- [ ] Sector-wise correlation breakdown
- [ ] GAT-style temporal attention
- [ ] Regime-based portfolio simulation
- [ ] Convert into a Streamlit dashboard
